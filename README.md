# PHYS321-final-project

Please grade the Analysis notebook. Note that it uses the python file "functions.py" and that the test functions for that file are in "functionTests.py".

Please also run 3DGraph.py to see a 3D model of the data for the creativity points!!

The data scrapping stuff is the code we wrote to get the data from the html from the website "tranfermarkt". Hopefully this could get some creativity points for having to use html coding to grab data from the internet...?

Also see the final paper :)
